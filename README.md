# CS401: Data Privacy

# Programming Project 

The goal of this programming project is to expand your familiarity with k-anonymity through hands on expe-
rience. Projects should be completed in pairs (and 1 group of 3); group assignments are posted on notebowl.

Identify a publicly available dataset containing microdata. Your data should contain at least 10 attributes and
at least 1,000 records. Use the programming language of your choice to k-anonymize your data for at least
3 different k values. Be sure to clearly state how you defined the QID for your dataset and why. Your code
should create csv files containing your anonymized data. Using your anonymized datasets, demonstrate how a
changing k value impacted the utility of the data.


There should be 1 submission per group containing the following:

- Compressed folder containing: Code used to anonymize data, a README file detailing how to reproduce
    your results using the provided code, and either the original data you worked with or a file detailing how
    to access the data from its original source.
- A write up explaining the following: what values of k you used, how you defined your QID and why, how
    you measured utility, results demonstrating how this utility measure was impacted by the choice of k.

If you are having trouble finding data, the UCI Machine Learning Repositoryhttps://archive.ics.uci.
edu/ml/datasets.php and Kaggle Dataset Repositoryhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasetsare both good
places to search. Note that your code does not need to be dataset agnostic. That is to say, you can use your
knowledge of the features in your dataset to write your code. The code should simply be executable on the
dataset you choose so that Dr. Truex can reproduce your k-anonymized data.
