#Project 1
##Amna Khalid & Youssef Bourouphael

We have designed 3 functions that will work for different K values and once ran will create a .csv file that is named according to the k value (k2.csv,k4.csv, or k10.csv)

At the bottom of the code provided, there are comments that say to uncomment a function call and once uncommented, the code will run and create the csv file.

So to reiterate, uncomment the k2() to create a csv that anonymizes the data for k=2, k4() to anonymize for k=4, and k9() for k=9.

The source data will be included in the zip file. A link to the source will also be in the paper we turn in.
